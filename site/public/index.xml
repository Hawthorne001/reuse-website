      <description>Weâ€™re making managing copyrights and licenses in free and open source software easier. Our best practices are meant to demonstrate how to add copyright and license information to a project in ways which allow for more automation. We know you want to focus on coding, but there are a few simple steps to take to make the copyright and license of your project more easily understood.

      <description>Example repositories These repositories are basic, but each of them is REUSE compliant. We make them available to demonstrate how REUSE works in practice.
 Simple Hello - the most basic repository, a single source code file and license. Included Hello - a simple repository with included source code under a different license. SPDX Hello - a repository with Git commit hooks which automatically generate a bill of materials after each commit.</description>
